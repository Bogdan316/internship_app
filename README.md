# Internship App
Our goal was to create a reliable application for all students that aspire to participate in an internship. Because most phone users prefer a dedicated app over a website, we decided to develop an Android app using Flutter, therefore facilitating a simple future migration to iOS and Web. The project itself was designed to offer the companies the needed tools for handling both the internships and the studentâ€™s applications. In addition, previous internships are visible on the platform for a better understanding of the skills and interests of the student.
